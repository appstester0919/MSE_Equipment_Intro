I have two floors of laboratories (on the 7th and 2nd floors), each floor has different rooms with one or more equipment in each room. See the list below for details of the rooms and equipment arrangements. To introduce the equipment to the people, I have 4 recordings for each equipment, divided into simple and professional, and each of them is available in Putonghua and English.

I would like to design a website that starts with a screen divided into two halves, one for the 7th floor lab or the other for the 2nd floor lab. After selecting the floor of the laboratory, the corresponding rooms are listed according to that floor. After selecting a room, a square picture of the equipment in the room is listed, and at the bottom of the screen there is a bar with two switches for selecting “General” and “Professional”, and “Mandarin” and “English”. There are two switches for selecting “General” and “Professional”, and “Putonghua” and “English”. When I click on the picture of the equipment, it will streaming play the corresponding lecture recording file according to my selection in the bottom bar of the screen.
